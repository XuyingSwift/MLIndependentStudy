#     # in the context of the Factored Evolutionary Algorithm (FEA) based on the information provided,

#     # Each factor is essentially a group of variables that are optimized together. 
#     # In FEA, the optimization problem is decomposed into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each corresponding to a factor. 
#     # By focusing on a subset of variables, these subpopulations can efficiently search for optimal or near-optimal solutions in their respective subspaces of the entire problem domain.
